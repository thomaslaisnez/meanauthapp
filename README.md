# meanauthapp
My MEAN Stack application

*This is a small MEAN Stack application that I have made for the Web Apps course at HoGent. It has an Angular 2 front-end
made with Angular-CLI, Express back-end, MongoDB database. It has authorization, so you need to be logged in to get to the
profile and dashboard pages.*
